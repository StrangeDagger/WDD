							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> A great UI comes down to the ability to communicate a message efficiently through design, and Gestalt principles help with achieving that goal.
								This principle relies on our brain's capability to process patterns and create an overall image representation in ours heads. The four main ideas of Getalt are Emergence (identifying outlined elements), Reification (recognising objects with missing parts), Multi-Stability (when looking at an ambiguous object, our brains will see a more dominant view over time), and Inavariance (perception of objects from different perspectives) </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I like that this article is easy to follow because of its layout. I also like the illustrations for the four key ideas of Gestalt, 
								which gives me an understanding of how design is executed. I like the color contrast between black and varying light colors
								to show distinction between various elements.  </p>
