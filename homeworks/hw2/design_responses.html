							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>This article taught me the importance of padding. It brings visual clarity and balance to 
								a UI which affects user experience positively. Also, white space creates focus points which is important for
							    drawing a user's attention to a functionality. White space also helps with organizing the relationships
								between elements in a UI, this is particularly super important when we have a crowded page like an ecommerce site.</p>
						</li>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I like the transparency by Wayfair in sharing their design ideas such as using multiples of 8
								for their padding. I also enjoyed the part where they called "White space is wasted space" a myth because
								more designers and clients need to understand human thinking processes when interacting with their UI. Also I agree that users
								will keep scrolling on a site so designers should not be afraid of white space pushing contents below the fold. This is 
								why there's hierarchy in terms of what content we want to show the users.
