					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, create a wireframe for one page of it using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. (use the 'img' tag!) Make sure to let us know what the name of your website is (Use the 'p' tag!)</p>
							<p> <img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/Page1.jpg"/> </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for the same website using the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.</p>
							<p> <img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/Page2.jpg"/>  </p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Responses</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? How does the design accomplish this? Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. (Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
							<p> This website makes watching movies/ films accessible. It also suggests movies/films based 
								on the user's interest. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>
							<p> I thought my website could use a little cleaning up as well as expanding on the snippets 
								functionality so I added a caroussel so we're not only limited to one suggestion. I also took out 
								the notifications icon because it serves no purpose if our landing page already
								shows newly released entries.
