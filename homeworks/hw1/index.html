            <li> Design process involves thinking through the step by step journey 
                of a product. Hierarchy, content, intent and audience are the four elements 
                that give us an idea on a product's design. By analyzing them, we will get a better
                sense of how we can improve upon it or start our design thinking process for our
                own product.  </li> 

            <li> I liked the GIFs for each app. It gave me more insight on why certain elements
                are incorporated, such as the text "try London" in the Airbnb app. I also appreciate
                that this article encourages those without design skill to still try.  </li>
            <li> "The placeholder text in the search bar could have just said “Search here” but instead they mention a specific city. Though I have no intention of going to London, seeing the possibility of it is exciting" </li>
            <li> This article was a 6 out of 10. </li>
        </ul>
