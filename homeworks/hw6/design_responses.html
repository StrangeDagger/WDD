							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned the importance of the proper use of animation in UX as well as essential principles
								that make animation effective. 200-500ms is optimal duration based on what our brain
								can process, but we also have to adjust based on which device we are 
								designing for: 200-300ms for mobile, 400-450ms for tablet, and 150-200ms for 
								wearables. Smaller objects also move faster than large object so in order to 
								find the balance we have to adjust the speed based on size. Lastly, easing makes
								animation appear more natural, particularly ease-in/out and ease-in-out.

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> As usual, I love when an article provides illustrations as well as 
								comparisons between good and bad. This article also provides clear guidelines
								that I can refer back to when I need ideas for better design thinking. One super
								particular part that caught my attention is having an acceleration curve animation next to
								the easing animation.

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "If the animation is built correctly, then it is unobtrusive and does not distract the users from their goals. If it does, you either need to soften it or even remove it at all."" </p>
						</li>
