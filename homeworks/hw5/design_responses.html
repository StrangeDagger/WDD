                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> This article taught me the power of simplistic yet beautiful design choices. Each UI is easy on the eyes. Also, I noticed taught
                                each UI didn't use over 5 different color in their palette which avoided oversaturation. </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I really enjoyed the UI of this article. The center alignment with flex-direction column made it 
                                seamless for me to navigate through the list of possible UX illustrations. I also like how straight forward it is. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> Overall, all the UIs are great but the two that stuck out to me the most are: Add to Cart by Dannniel for Norde and AI Powered Assistant by Lubos.
                                Dannniel's achieved making it easy for customers to purchase as well as customize their product. I also like the use of color blue and white because it is easy on the eyes. 
                                For Lubos's I particularly like this because I am into Geospatial Tech and this is right up the caliber of what 
                                I would take inspiration from when designing interactive maps! The dark color paired with the blue makes it easy to emphasize
                                navigational direction.  </p>
                        </li>
