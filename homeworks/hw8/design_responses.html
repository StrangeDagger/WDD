					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> This article pretty much explains in detail what dark pattern is and does, and 
							to look out for signs which are outlined throughout the article. Companies use these patterns with
							mostly self-serving intent by deceieving users into doing something that benefits the company. Design choices have become more sneaky over time but luckily deceptive.design
							lists down the different dark pattern types and their description. 
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part of this article is the very last quote which says "Find a way
							to help the vulnerable around you. If you have privilege, use it for good." UI and UX designers
							have the skillsets required to make compelling websites and businesses usually rely on them for that
						 	and that is a privilege that many of those in the field tend to forget when they are under a corporate umbrella.
							The author's value aligns with mine in basically standing up for human agency by speaking up and learning to stand up
							for what is ethically and morally correct. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "Dark Patterns is not a good, ethical practice and how designers should be responsible for their actions and focus on creating transparency with the users instead of manipulating them." </p>
					</li>
