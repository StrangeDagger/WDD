							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Font choice should take into consideration the type of audience we have and their 
								 age, interests, and cultural upbringing. For children, Sassoon Primary is a great font due to 
								spacing and ease of legibility. For seniors, it's high contrast colors with minimal deco styles.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I like that this article provides links to free fonts! I'm pretty basic with my TNR or Arial, but 
								I am always open to experimenting with other fonts to make my site attractive! Another favorite of mine 
								are the example illustrations all over the page that showcase different fonts!  </p>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
